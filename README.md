# Fair Contest

-----------------------------

This project aims to create a simple Programming Marathon Submission System so
the Contestant can read the questions, start an answer submission, get the
input, send the input to their algorithm, paste the output in the textarea then
send it to the backend to compare against the expected answer. In other words,
it's fair because it do not limit the Contestant to the backend allowed
languages; in fact, they can use any language they are used to.

Thanks to Microsoft Coding Competition to bring up the system idea.
Unfortunately their system is not Open Source nor free to use.
